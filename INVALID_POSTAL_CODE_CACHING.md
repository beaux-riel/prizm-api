# Invalid Postal Code Caching - Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

I've successfully implemented comprehensive caching for invalid postal codes to dramatically reduce unnecessary API calls to the PRIZM website. Here's what's now cached:

### Types of Invalid Postal Codes Now Cached:

1. **Format Validation Errors** (e.g., "INVALID", "123", "ABC123")

   - Caught in Flask app before making any API calls
   - Cached for 90 days (permanent - format won't change)
   - Location: `app.py` - `get_prizm_code()` function

2. **PRIZM Website Invalid Postal Codes** (e.g., "Z9Z 9Z9" - valid format but not assigned)

   - Detected when PRIZM website returns error message: "not assigned to a segment"
   - Cached for 90 days (permanent - assignment won't change)
   - Location: `scrape_logic.py` - `get_segment_number()` function

3. **General API Errors** (network issues, timeouts, website changes)
   - Any other errors during scraping process
   - Cached for 7 days (temporary - may resolve)
   - Location: `scrape_logic.py` - `get_segment_number()` exception handler

## Cache Duration Strategy

- **Successful results**: 90 days (full duration)
- **Invalid format**: 90 days (permanent - format validation won't change)
- **Invalid postal codes**: 90 days (permanent - PRIZM assignments are stable)
- **General errors**: 7 days (temporary - network/website issues may resolve)

## Benefits

### Before (without invalid postal code caching):

- Every invalid postal code attempt = 1 API call to PRIZM website
- Users testing bad postal codes repeatedly = multiple wasted API calls
- Format errors still trigger web scraping attempts

### After (with invalid postal code caching):

- First invalid postal code attempt = 1 API call + cached for future
- Subsequent attempts = instant response from cache (no API call)
- Format errors = instant response (no web scraping at all)

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User tries invalid format "INVALID"

1. **First time**: Caught by format validation, cached instantly, no API call made
2. **Subsequent times**: Returns from cache instantly

### Scenario 2: User tries "Z9Z 9Z9" (valid format, invalid code)

1. **First time**: API call made, PRIZM returns error, error result cached
2. **Subsequent times**: Returns cached error instantly, no API call

### Scenario 3: Network error occurs

1. **First time**: Network error cached for 7 days
2. **Next 7 days**: Returns cached error
3. **After 7 days**: Cache expires, will retry API call (error may be resolved)

## Testing

Use the test script to verify caching works:

```bash
python test_invalid_caching.py
```

This tests various invalid postal codes and shows:

- First request timing (slow - API call)
- Second request timing (fast - from cache)
- Cache hit/miss status
- Performance improvement metrics

## Cache Statistics

The cache now tracks all types of requests:

- Total cached entries (valid + invalid)
- Cache hit rate improvements
- Database size and performance metrics

This implementation ensures that your daily API limit of 10 calls to the PRIZM website is preserved for legitimate, new postal code lookups rather than being wasted on repeated invalid postal code attempts.
