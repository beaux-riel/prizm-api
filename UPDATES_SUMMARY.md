# PRIZM API Frontend & Backend Updates Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Updates (`app.py`)

- **Removed redundant `who_they_are` field** from all API responses
- **Updated API response structure** to include all comprehensive demographic fields:
  - `postal_code`
  - `prizm_code`
  - `segment_name`
  - `segment_description` (now includes the full description with "who they are" content)
  - `average_household_income`
  - `education`
  - `urbanity`
  - `average_household_net_worth`
  - `occupation`
  - `diversity`
  - `family_life`
  - `tenure`
  - `home_type`
  - `status`

### 2. Frontend HTML Updates (`templates/index.html`)

- **Enhanced single postal code display** with organized sections:
  - Financial Profile (income, net worth)
  - Demographics & Lifestyle (education, urbanity, occupation, diversity, family life)
  - Housing (tenure, home type)
- **Improved batch results table** with:
  - Updated column headers (replaced "Net Worth" with "Education" for better overview)
  - Expandable details for each result
  - Organized detail view with three categories: Financial Profile, Demographics, Lifestyle & Housing
- **Removed redundant "Who They Are" sections** since this content is now included in the segment description
- **Updated API documentation** to reflect the current response format

### 3. Data Flow

- The `scrape_logic.py` already captures all comprehensive demographic data
- The "segment_description" field now contains both the short description and detailed "who they are" content, separated by " | "
- All demographic fields are properly mapped from the scraping results to the API response

## Testing Results

### Single Postal Code API

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8081/api/prizm?postal_code=V8A2P4"
```

✅ Returns comprehensive data with all 13 fields populated

### Batch Postal Code API

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8081/api/prizm/batch" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"postal_codes": ["V8A2P4", "M5V2H1"]}'
```

✅ Returns array of results with comprehensive data for each postal code

## Frontend Features

- ✅ Single lookup displays all demographic data in organized sections
- ✅ Batch lookup shows summary table with expandable details
- ✅ Clean, modern UI with responsive design
- ✅ Loading indicators for better user experience
- ✅ Error handling for invalid postal codes

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/prizm?postal_code=<CODE>` - Single postal code lookup
- `POST /api/prizm/batch` - Batch postal code lookup (max 50 codes)
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /` - Web interface

The application now successfully displays all captured demographic data fields in both single and batch requests, with no redundant information and a clean, organized presentation layer.
